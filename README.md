# Intro

Hey! I'm Nicohlas. I'm a Full Stack Developer from Australia, with 7 years of experience within programming, I know it may sound crazy, but here's my explanation:
My dad used to work with tech (in the army) & he used to teach me how to code, etc.

# About Me

I love to play video games! I know it may come as a surprise, since I am a 14 year old teenager.. *sarcasm*, but I play games in my free time (while im not crying, or programming)! I love video games such as: BeamNG.Drive, DiRT Rally 2.0, and more!

I have Autism & ADHD, I have two dogs, & I love cats!
